This is where things started to get tricky. I knew what type of game I believed to work best for this project, but I had to figure out the best way to incorporate emotion regulation. While adults and children with ADHD have similar emotional problems, the difference is usually the adult knows how they are supposed to react and handle certain situations, but it is hard for them to be able to think about how to handle things in the middle of an emotional outburst. The best thing to do during an emotional outburst is to slow down your breathing so you can calm down and collect yourself. With this information, I needed to build some effective relationship between respiration and a video game where the user will have to indirectly focus on their breathing rate while playing the game.
