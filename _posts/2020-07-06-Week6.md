BOOM! This is where I realized how to attack this biofeedback game to be efficient without over penalizing the player. When you give a player penalties for messing up their breathing, it could be a motivation to make the player fix it right away, but it also has the possibility of stressing the player out even more in the situation pushing them to lose faster. This would not be beneficial to anybody with ADHD because it just pushes them to get angrier with themselves which can result in even more mistakes. So I wanted the progression to only be linear, if they can sustain their deep breathing then they can move up in difficulty of levels, but if they make a mistake, they will be stuck at that level and their points will not be able to add up during that time until they fix their breathing. The purpose of the game is to get as far as you can and earn as many points as you can, so there's already that incentive to have players want to fix their breathing so it is not constantly paused.
