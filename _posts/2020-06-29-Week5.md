I went through many ways and read even more papers to figure out the best way to build a relationship between respiration and a video game. Some of those ways scrambling the board game, giving the player penalizing points that forces them to lose quicker, or slow down the game every time they do make a breathing error. The point of this game is to still play the game; however, in order to keep excelling in the game a person has to have a constant breath of about six breaths per minute. I couldn't figure out the best type of penalty to give the a general game because each penalty has faults, but overall, each penalty has the possibility to make a player angrier if they do not slow their breathing back down after their first mistake. So then I needed to backtrack and figure out a way that doesn't weaken's a person's ability to play the game, but creates an incentive for them to constantly think of their breathing.
