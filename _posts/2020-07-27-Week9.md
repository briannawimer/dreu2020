There was a lot of trial and error with OpenCV, but I believe there is someway to figure out how a person is breathing due to the meanshift and/or optical flow while their video camera is running. This week was really busy with finding how to make breathing evident in videos, seeing how OpenCV works, and seeing what OpenCV can collect in relationship to respirations.
