After pinpointing exactly what I wanted to do for my summer research as to thinking of some biofeedback game that could potentially help users with ADHD regulate their emotions. So this week, I worked on figuring out which type of games could be useful for this game. I came up with three important game characteristics: 1) This game must speed up at regular intervals, 2) The purpose of the game is to go for as long as you can, 3) the game will not end until the player dies. With these characteristics, a few popular examples I thought of was Pac-Man and Tetris. It also benefits the user that these are quick-thinking skilled games.
