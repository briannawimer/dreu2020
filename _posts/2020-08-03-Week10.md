Last week of the program, this week was spent working more on finishing up the final project paper of all my research for the summer. Also, revising it a few times to make sure all my ideas flowed together. I was writing this paper all summer, but it needed repolishing because I learned so much more this summer about every aspect of research and writing papers. While this paper is not finished yet, my mentor and me agreed to keep working eith each other throughout the school year to conduct an actual study for this idea, and turn it into a conference paper that can hopefully be submitted later this year.
