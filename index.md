## About Me

My name is Brianna Wimer, and I am currently a junior at The University of Alabama. I will be receiving my BS in Computer Science Summer of 2021. After graduating, I hope to have been accepted into a Ph.D. program to contunie research. My research interests are in Human-Computer Interaction and Assisstive Technology.

## About My Mentor

[Elaine Schaertl Short](https://engineering.tufts.edu/cs/people/faculty/elaine-short) is the Clare Boothe Luce Assistant Professor in the Tufts University Department of Computer Science. Her research focuses on building algorithms that enable robust assistive human-robot interaction in schools, homes, crowds, and other natural environments.

## About My Project

I had the oppurtunity to begin an independent research project in which I began attempting to find ways to build a reward system in games to improve emotion regulation for people with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. Then, I developed a version of the reward system within a standard Tetris game.
